# ManagementPortal

ManagementPortal is an application which is used to manage pilot studies for [RADAR-CNS](http://www.radar-cns.org/).

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get ManagementPortal up and running in production mode is by using the included
docker-compose files. 
1. First, we need to generate a key pair for signing JWT tokens: `keytool -genkey -alias selfsigned -keyalg RSA -keystore src/main/docker/etc/config/keystore.jks -keysize 4048 -storepass radarbase`

**Make sure the key password and store password are the same!** This is a requirement for Spring Security.

2. Then, make sure [Docker][] and [Docker-Compose][] are installed on your system.
3. Finally, we can start the stack with `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/management-portal.yml up -d`.

For more details on configuring Management Portal we refer to the readme on our [Github repository].
